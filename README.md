# TamesQ
Tames Q(uick) is a light and updated version of Tames that targets WebGL and surveying ability. The main differences between this version and the original one is the simplification and combination of most of the "Marker" components into one QMarker which represents almost all interactive and dynamic elements, as well as the UI.

I gradually put tutorial videos in the Follyverse's YouTube channel:

The current UI text formatting is discussed in the Quick Guide:
